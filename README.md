Toontown
=================
Toontown is a free, non-profit game inspired by _Disney's Toontown Online_.


### Our Goal ###
The idea behind this project is to restore Toontown Online to its **original state**. This means that I plan on removing all modifications Toontown Infinite had planned for the gameplay, as well as restoring all broken features from Toontown Online up to the point of discontinuation date of September 19, 2013, excluding the Toon News feature. If you would like to add your own customization to the game that does not fall in line with the original Toontown experience, please fork this for your own usage case.

No profanity allowed, keep it professional.

### Contributing ###
Don't just start contributing. We talk about what we are about to do before we do it! All changes, except for emergency bug fixes, should be done in either a separate branch, or a fork -- **not** to the master or release branches. When you are ready to merge your changes, submit a _pull request_ for review.

### Requirements ###
This version of the software requires a slightly modified version of the Panda3d game engine to correctly function, this issue will be addressed later.

This also requires an older version of Astron to be compiled (v0.1.0)

You will need to compile the requirements yourself, thank you.
