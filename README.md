Toontown
=================
Toontown is a free, non-profit game inspired by _Disney's Toontown Online_.


### The Goal ###
The idea behind this project is to restore Toontown Online to its **original state** that the game was in when it closed in 2013. I will not be accepting modifications that change the gameplay, if you would like to do so, please fork the repository and add your tweaks there.

### Contact ###
This repository will soon have a Discord server. Thank you.

### Contributing ###
Don't just start contributing. We talk about what we are about to do before we do it! All changes, except for emergency bug fixes, should be done in either a separate branch, or a fork -- **not** to the master or release branches. When you are ready to merge your changes, submit a _pull request_ for review.

We will be using a specific modified version of Panda3D for running this software.

I will soon have a compiled version of Panda3D and Astron available for anyone who would like to run this software and help contribute.

**Note:** Issues submitted in this repository are designed for *code-related* issues only. Issues involving starting the game will be ignored. Please view the [dependencies](https://github.com/ToontownInfinite/src/wiki/Dependencies) page in the wiki for help starting Toontown.
